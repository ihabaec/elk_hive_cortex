### Phishing-Initiative 
[Phishing-Initiative](https://phishing-initiative.fr/)  ables any Internet user to help fight against phishing attacks. When reporting us the address of a suspected phishing website, weâ€™ll analyze it and have it blocked in the participating Web browsers.

The analyzer comes in two flavours: lookup and scan. The first search in the database and can be used with basic API access while the second one requires higher profile role.

#### Requirements
You need a valid Phishing-Initiative API integration subscription to use the analyzer.

- Provide your API key as values for the `key` parameter.
