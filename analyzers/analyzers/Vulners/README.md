### Vulners-analyzer
 
This analyzer consists of 2 parts.
1. **Vulners_IOC**: As a result of collaboration between Vulners and RST Threat Feed, the idea was to send IOC analysis results through theHive analyzer: blog post
2. **Vulners_CVE**: Vulners have a strong vulnerability database. This data is useful if:
"if the case (incident) is related to the exploitation of a vulnerability, then the analyst (manually / automatically) can add it to observables and quickly get all the basic information on it in order to continue analyzing the case."

Vulners API key required.

#### Setting up analyzer

* copy the folders "Vulners" analyzer & "Vulners" into your Cortex analyzer path
* install necessary python modules from the requirements.txt (**pip install -r requirements.txt**)
* restart Cortex to initialize the new Responder "**systemctl restart cortex**"

Get your Vulners api key: ![Vulners API](assets/vulners_api.png)

Add your Vulners API in Cortex settings: ![API key in Cortex](assets/Cortex_settings.PNG)

#### Add Observable type in TheHive

By default theHive does not have a "cve" type to be observables, so we have to add it to Administrator Settings:
