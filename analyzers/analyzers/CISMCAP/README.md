The Center for Internet Security, Inc. (CIS®) makes the connected world a safer place for people, businesses, and governments through our core competencies of collaboration and innovation. CIS is home to the Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center® (MS-ISAC®), the trusted resource for cyber threat prevention, protection, response, and recovery for U.S. State, Local, Tribal, and Territorial government entities, and the Elections Infrastructure Information Sharing and Analysis Center® (EI-ISAC®), which supports the rapidly changing cybersecurity needs of U.S. elections offices.

Malicious Code Analysis Platform (MCAP) is a no-cost web-based sandbox which enables MS-ISAC and EI-ISAC members to submit suspicious files such as executables, DLLs, documents, quarantine files, and archives for analysis in a controlled and non-public fashion. The platform also enables users to perform threat analysis based on domain, IP address, URL, hashes, and various Indicators of Compromise (IOCs).

This analyzer allows you to submit a variety of observables to MCAP to analyze files or check feeds for known indicators of compromise for other data types.
