### Cyberchef
[Cyberchef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/) is a simple, intuitive web app for carrying out all manner of "cyber" operations within a web browser. These operations include simple encoding like XOR or Base64, more complex encryption like AES, DES and Blowfish, creating binary and hexdumps, compression and decompression of data, calculating hashes and checksums, IPv6 and X.509 parsing, changing character encodings, and much more.

The analyzer comes in three flavours to help you convert from base64, hex or CharCode.

#### Requirements
You need to deploy [Cyberchef-server](https://github.com/gchq/CyberChef-server) on your infrastructure.

The url of the server must be used to configure the `url` parameter.
