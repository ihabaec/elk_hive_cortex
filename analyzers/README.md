# Contributing

We welcome your **[contributions for new analyzers](https://thehive-project.github.io/Cortex-Analyzers/dev_guides/how-to-create-an-analyzer/)**
that can take away the load off overworked fellow analysts or improvements to existing ones. Please feel free to fork the code, play with it, make some patches and send us pull requests using [issues](https://github.com/TheHive-Project/Cortex-analyzers/issues).

**Important**: To make it easy for every one, please send **one** pull request per analyzer. It will help us reviewing the code, and merging as soon as feasible.

We do have a [Code of conduct](code_of_conduct.md). Make sure to check it out before contributing.
