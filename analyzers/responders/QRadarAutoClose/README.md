Simple responder to close a QRadar Offense through a simple clic !

If you need to change the customfield which contain the QRadar Offense ID, change the "externalReferences" from QRadarAutoClose.py line 15.
Be careful this have to be fulfill with the "Internal Reference" of the customfield, not it's name !
