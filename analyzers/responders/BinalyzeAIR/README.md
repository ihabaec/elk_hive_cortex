### What is Binalyze AIR?

AIR is an "Automated Incident Response" platform that provides the complete feature set for:

- Remotely collecting 300+ evidence types in minutes,
- Capturing the "Forensic State" of an endpoint as a well-organized HTML/JSON report,
- Performing triage on thousands of endpoints using YARA,
- Integrating with SIEM/SOAR/EDR products for automating the response phase IR,
- Enriching alerts for eliminating false positives,
- Investigating pre-cursors generated by other security products.

#### What does this integration do?

This responder lets you start acquisition and isolation of an endpoint with Binalyze AIR. 

##### Acquisition
One of the core features of AIR is collecting evidence remotely. This feature is made possible by "Acquisition Profiles," a group of different evidence categories. With this integration, you can use following profiles:

- Full,
- Quick,
- Memory (RAM + PageFile),
- Event Logs,
- Browsing History,
- Compromise Assessment
- And much more!

##### Isolation

Endpoint isolation works by terminating all connections of an endpoint and not allowing any new connections.
When an endpoint is isolated, you can still perform tasks such as Acquisition.
